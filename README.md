### NOTE: This repo only provides release downloads. Check the [releases](https://github.com/ColossusChang/VoicesVoicesExtravaganza/releases) page to download the mod.

- MOD VERSION: 1.0
- AUTHOR: Colossus
- GAMES: BGEE, EET, BG1+TOTSC

## Introduction

Adds AI-generated English voiceovers for all characters from Baldur's Gate 1, including the base game and Tales of the Sword Coast. Does not include The Black Pits, the Tutorial, or Siege of Dragonspear.

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), or Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET). When installing the mod on EET, you may install it before or after EET_End.

This mod will work when installed in the middle of a playthrough.

Compatibility with legacy BG1 + TOTSC is also supported. However, some lines differ between the enhanced edition and the legacy edition. These lines will be voiced according to the enhanced edition version.

Compatibility with TUTU, BGT, or TUTU TOTSC is unknown. You're welcome to try it and report back.

Compatibility with other mods is not guaranteed, but in theory it should not conflict with other mods.

## Installing the mod

1. If you are installing on A BGEE game with SoD installed, and it's from GOG or Steam, you will need to install [Modmerge](https://github.com/ScottBrooks/modmerge/releases) or [DLCMerger](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger) before installing this mod.
2. Copy all contents of the compressed file to your game directory. 
3. Run `setup-vveBG.exe` and follow the instructions.
